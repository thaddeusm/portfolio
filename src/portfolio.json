When I inherited this legacy project, non admin users were expected to navigate not only a custom frontend, but also periodically the WordPress admin panel to create and edit posts and manage their comments. One of the more major changes I implemented were frontend views to prevent community members from ever needing to see the admin panel. Now, most newer members likely have no idea that the community is powered by WordPress."

				"background": "In my role as IT Projects Developer at Georgetown University, I conduct accessibility reviews and apply code improvements twice a year. Each time I analyze our site with accessibility checkers (e.g. SiteImprove), I find an ever larger number of images that are missing alt text, which leaves users with visual impairments or slow connections unable to receive any benefit from these images. Since others on our team who are not as familiar with web accessibiliy update the content of the site, this issue has been challenging for me to address.",
				"details": "I decided to create a plugin rather than adding custom functionality to our organization's WordPress sites as I expect this is a widespread issue. The plugin searches the site's Media Library for images without alt text and then allows the user to have alt text generated by Open AI's ChatGPT 5 Nano using their own OpenAI API key. This allows me to make the plugin itself free to install with the costs negotiated between the user and Open AI. The actual communication between the WordPress installation and Open AI is handled by a microservice I created using Vercel's AI SDK.",
				"reflection": "This was my first attempt to make a WordPress plugin, which helped me better understand WordPress admin panel features and tooling such as the Settings API. Though similar plugins already exist on the WordPress marketplace, I found that they obscured they had opaque cost structures. One of the biggest issues with AI models at the moment is their variable pricing. The largest services charge based upon usage tokens with no industry standard. This makes it hard for a user, let alone a AI-powered service to determine a fair subscription price. Providing this type of plugin for free works as an experiemental or educational project, but it is not a sustainable way to support the developer community in finding practical applications of AI."

				"details": "Rather than working with Open AI's API directly within the WordPress backend I decided to use Vercel's AI SDK in a separate server environment for several reasons. First, I wanted to allow for the possibility of creating interfaces for other platforms with the same underlying features. Also, Vercel's AI SDK allows you to use many different models from different providers with the same API. Since generative AI is rapidly evolving, I would like to be able to more quickly adapt to new models or services that could provide descriptions of images more accurately or efficiently.",
				"reflection": "Though this was my first time working with the AI SDK, I had a workable prototype of the service up and running within less than an hour. It almost took more time to set up an Open AI API account than to create this functionality. Vercel has done their part in trying to make AI models available to developers, but it remains to be seen how many beneficial and affordable use cases there may be."

Paper-based seating charts with spaces for annotation have been in use for some time and are still the preferred choice for many faculty members. Seatsmart offers a digital alternative as a convenience, while striving to add features that are difficult to implement in analog (e.g. trend calculations, randomization, etc.). The choice of colors and typography is meant to fit the university context (adult learners).",

Seatsmart is designed to be offline-first, with all data stored on the user's machine. This storage is transparently located in the default OS documents folder, which is separate from application files. This allows the user to update (replace) the application without impacting partication records. \nWhen Internet access is available, instructors can use the Remote feature to access basic features from a mobile device. They can also engage with students in Activities for realtime formative assessments. Data is encrypted during transport and this information is not stored in any cloud database. This is powered by a realtime server on the backend. \nEvery attempt is made to ensure design and UX consistency for PC and Mac, the operating systems currently used by faculty. However, desktop (larger) screen sizes are given less priority as faculty are provided or rely upon laptop computers. An additional effort has been made to support OSX-specific APIs such as the touchbar, recognizing that faculty members who have chosen to purchase their own computers have sometimes selected more advanced Apple computers with this feature.",
				"reflection": "As a standalone application, Seatsmart currently includes all planned functionality.  However, due to the public health crisis in China in 2020, face-to-face instruction has been interrupted, which puts this project on hold."
