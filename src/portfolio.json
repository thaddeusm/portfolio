			"description": {
				"background": "Seatsmart offers a convenient way to implement classroom participation guidance by the Department of English at Fort Hays State University for courses conducted at campuses in China. \nAt its core, Seatsmart is a simple implementation of instructor classroom management practices that are considered effective for courses conducted at FHSU satellite campuses in China. Paper-based seating charts with spaces for annotation have been in use for some time and are still the preferred choice for many faculty members. Seatsmart offers a digital alternative as a convenience, while striving to add features that are difficult to implement in analog (e.g. trend calculations, randomization, etc.). The choice of colors and typography is meant to fit the university context (adult learners).",
				"details": "Internet connection stability is a serious concern for faculty. In addition, the application deals with student records related to participation, which should be stored securely. Seatsmart is designed to be offline-first, with all data stored on the user's machine. This storage is transparently located in the default OS documents folder, which is separate from application files. This allows the user to update (replace) the application without impacting partication records. \nWhen Internet access is available, instructors can use the Remote feature to access basic features from a mobile device. They can also engage with students in Activities for realtime formative assessments. Data is encrypted during transport and this information is not stored in any cloud database. This is powered by a realtime server on the backend. \nEvery attempt is made to ensure design and UX consistency for PC and Mac, the operating systems currently used by faculty. However, desktop (larger) screen sizes are given less priority as faculty are provided or rely upon laptop computers. An additional effort has been made to support OSX-specific APIs such as the touchbar, recognizing that faculty members who have chosen to purchase their own computers have sometimes selected more advanced Apple computers with this feature.",
				"reflection": "As a standalone application, Seatsmart currently includes all planned functionality.  However, due to the public health crisis in China in 2020, face-to-face instruction has been interrupted, which puts this project on hold."
